# Ontology of Control Systems Engineering (OCSE)

This repo contains formally represented knowledge of the domain of *Control Engineering*.


## History and Background

Until 2022-10-01 the repo with primary URL (<https://github.com/ackrep-org/ocse/>) held the OWL-based version 0.1 of the OCSE, which was referenced in some publications. The current version of the OCSE (0.2) is developed using the [ERK framework](https://github.com/ackrep-org/pyerk-core) and is thus incompatible. Version 0.1 is now available under <https://github.com/ackrep-org/ocse-0.1>.
