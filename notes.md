## Entries that require more theoretical knowledge to be examined

## Ideas

- Some best practices on how a theorem label should be crafted?
  - e.g. if the assertion yields an existence result mention that in the label? 
- Offer some wrapper for the state-space related boiler plate

## Open Questions

- What is the problem with matrix-vector multiplication?
- What does the I000_magic do?
